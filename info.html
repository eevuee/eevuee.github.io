        <p>Hi! My name is usernamehere.</p>
        <p>I'm a student, freelance artist and animator as well as a streamer and a generally online person. I started
            drawing as a kid
            but have recently started taking it a bit more seriously. I currently have very little free time, but the
            time I have is spent by
            reading, crocheting and sewing, and playing games.

            During these past couple of years, I've worked with multiple individuals and companies to bring their ideas
            to life; be it 2D or 3D.
            My creative hobbies help me take my mind off of the stress and I feel very privileged to be able to make a
            living from doing something
            I love!

            In the future, I am to graduate from my current studies and gain more tech-related knowledge to further my
            somewhat unserious
            life goal of becoming a 21st century Renaissance man.
